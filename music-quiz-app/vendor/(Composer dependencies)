The vendor directory is typically managed by Composer and contains the installed dependencies for your PHP project. As such, it is not manually edited or populated with code. Therefore, the contents of the vendor directory will be generated automatically when you run Composer commands to install your dependencies.

The contents of the file /music-quiz-app/music-quiz-app/vendor/ are intentionally left blank.
